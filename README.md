# PyBer_Analysis
Utilize the capabilities of Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize ride-sharing data.

## Overview of Project
>V. Isualize, Co-Founder of PyBer, has asked for a new task. Using our knowledge of Python and Pandas, we must create a summary DataFrame from the ride-sharing data broken down by city type. Next, we'll use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fare for each category of city. We will next produce a written report that explains the changes in the data by city type and how PyBer decision-makers might utilize those variations.

## Results


### Total Fares
>Compared to Suburban and Rural cities, Urban cities had higher total fares.
- Rural - 4327.93
- Suburban - 19356.33
- Urban - 39854.38


### Total Rides
>Compared to suburban and rural communities, Urban cities have more rides.
- Rural - 125
- Suburban - 625
- Urban - 1625


### Total Drivers
>Compared to Suburban and Rural cities, Urban cities have more drivers.
- Rural - 78
- Suburban - 490
- Urban - 2405


### Average Fare per Ride
>Compared to Suburban and Rural cities, the average fare per ride is higher in rural cities.
- Rural - 34.623440
- Suburban - 30.970128
- Urban - 24.525772


### Average Fare per Driver
>Compared to Suburban and Rural cities, the average fare per driver is higher in rural cities.
- Rural - 55.486282
- Suburban - 39.502714
- Urban - 16.571468

### Average Fare per Ride & Average Fare per Driver

- With a decline in population, the average fare per ride and per driver both rise.

### Total Fares for January-April 2019
>To visualize this dataframe, an object-oriented interface is shown in the figure below.

## Summary
### Based on the results of the analysis above, it can be shown that total fares in rural and suburban areas are much lower than in urban areas. The CEO is given the following business advice:
- Costs for transportation in the urban market should be raised. The number of rides in the Urban market is far higher than in the other areas, thus even a little increase in the price per ride could have a big impact.
- Reduce the cost of rides in rural and suburban regions to entice more individuals to use the service. Providing incentives to retain devoted passengers and drivers and draw in new riders and drivers.
- More drivers should be employed in the rural and suburban areas to reduce wait times. This should also increase the number of rides in these markets.

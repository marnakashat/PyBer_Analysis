# PyBer_Analysis
Utilize the capabilities of Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize ride-sharing data.

## Overview of Project
>V. Isualize, Co-Founder of PyBer, has asked for a new task. Using our knowledge of Python and Pandas, we must create a summary DataFrame from the ride-sharing data broken down by city type. Next, we'll use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fare for each category of city. We will next produce a written report that explains the changes in the data by city type and how PyBer decision-makers might utilize those variations.

## Results

1. Urban city has more rides compared to Suburban and Rural cities.
- Rural - 125
- Suburban - 625
- Urban - 1625

### Average Fare per Ride & Average Fare per Driver

> - With a decline in population, the average fare per ride and per driver both rise.

### Total Fares for January-April 2019
>To visualize this dataframe, an object-oriented interface is shown in the figure below.
